# Marbling Effect with Tkinter

This Python script generates a marbling effect using circles in a Tkinter canvas. It allows users to customize various parameters such as the number of sides of the polygons, the size of the circles, and whether the size should be random or fixed. Users can also interact with the canvas using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to create unique patterns.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```
    pip install tk
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

4. Adjust the parameters using the sliders in the GUI:
   - **Polygon Count Sides**: Adjust the number of sides for the polygons created by the circles.
   - **Size**: Set the size of the circles. If "Random Size" is checked, the size will vary randomly; otherwise, it will be fixed.
   - **Random Size**: Check this box to enable random sizing of the circles.

5. Click on the canvas to place circles and create patterns.
6. Use the keyboard shortcuts "w" and "s" to adjust the pattern vertically.
7. Experiment with different settings to create unique marbling effects!
